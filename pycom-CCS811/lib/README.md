# CCS811
MicroPython driver for LoPy
This driver is from [https://gist.github.com/jiemde/481161c426c90c73e52aa51acfd94c2b]  
jiemde was kind enough to share it. 
Just adding some tweeks, working with the CCS811 from Adafruit [http://adafru.it/3566]  
MicroPython driver, NOT CurcitPython, significant differences between them.
